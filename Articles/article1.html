                    <h1>Welcome to the new Voyager</h1>
                    <p class="box-1-p">
                        Today is a big day for all of us here at Voyager.
                        Why? Because it marks the beginning of a new journey
                        and our unwavering commitment to you. We’re creating
                        a whole new Voyager, and we’re building it around you.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We know that travel is made better when you have a
                        companion who really understands your wants and
                        needs—someone who “gets” you. You need more than just
                        another travel company. From the moment you book, to
                        the second you come back home, you need someone with
                        you at every step of the journey.
                    </p>
                    <P>
                        The past year was tough on everyone—emotionally,
                        financially, even physically. The pandemic affected
                        many people’s travel plans, seemingly all at once,
                        and we weren’t as prepared as we would have liked.
                        But we listened, and we learned.
                    </P>
                    <p>
                        The COVID-19 crisis made it clear that we needed a
                        more direct way to get feedback from you, which led
                        us to launch the Voyager Crew, a group of super
                        Voyager users—some of them fans, others not—to tell
                        us what’s working and, more importantly, what’s not.
                        We’ve already acted on much of the feedback. Here’s
                        what’s changing at Voyager.

                <h2>Find trips that fit a flexible lifestyle</h2>
                <p>
                    We've added new ways for you to make booking and
                    changing reservations easier, and introduced filters
                    to help you quickly find flexible booking options.
                    When searching, simply look for hotels marked with
                    "free cancellation" so you can book with peace of
                    mind knowing that if your plans change so can your trip.

                <p>
                    Beyond making flexible options more apparent, we’re
                    also adding more information on the health and safety
                    measures implemented by travel providers. While searching
                    for accommodations, click on the “enhanced cleaning” filter
                    to see vetted properties. See more with our COVID-19

                <p>
                    We heard loud and clear that it was difficult for you
                    to understand exactly what you were getting when selecting
                    flights and accommodations with us, which is why we’ve created
                    an enhanced shopping experience that clearly outlines what’s
                    included in the rate you see. Whether it’s understanding the
                    differences between Basic Economy and Economy, to knowing
                    whether or not parking is included, we’re making it easier
                    for you to get exactly what you need.
