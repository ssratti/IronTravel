                    One of the first things to do before you start
                    booking the trip is make sure that both families
                    agree on the luxury level and price of the hotels
                    you’ll be staying in, at your destination and
                    en route, if taking a road trip. Deciding on a
                    star rating and price cap beforehand can help
                    you avoid uncomfortable discussions on the road,
                    and keep the mood light. At Voyager.com,
                    you can filter by both star-rating, price,
                    amenities and other preferences, which should
                    make it pretty easy for both families to find
                    something everyone can agree on.

                <p>
                    Although it may not be necessary to have adjoining
                    rooms, rooms across the hall or directly next to one
                    another is a good idea. If the kids all share pizza,
                    for example, think how fun a pajama party can be while
                    watching a movie and eating slices. Being close to
                    each other eliminates whining and the potential for
                    running through the hotel looking for their friends.
                    If the rooms are adjoining, evenings could be a bit
                    more relaxed: One room could be a parent space while
                    the kids have their own fun, within eye and ear range.

                    If families want to travel within their own car, that will
                    work fine. More likely, however, kids may want to be in
                    the car with kids close to their ages. Decide ahead of
                    time which combination of kids will ride in which car, so
                    every stop doesn’t end in an argument over who sits where.
                    Another idea can be to switch it up at rest stops to avoid
                    fights.

                    Your family may want to do something different at some point,
                    and that’s okay. “Some may want to nap, some may want to go to
                    a cafe, some may way to go to a museum, etc.,” says Alex Miller,
                    founder & CEO of UpgradedPoints.com. “Purposely schedule free time
                    so folks have a chance to either decompress or do activities they
                    want to do,”

                <p>
                    If both couples agree, why not plan a date night and let your f
                    riends watch your kids? Having a babysitter can free up a fun and
                    elaxing time to connect with your partner without the distraction
                    of your children.

                    In addition to couple time, consider an afternoon for the moms to
                    shop or the guys to watch a game on TV. Everyone, no matter how much
                    they love their spouse and kids, could use a break. While the adult
                    pals are out enjoying some adult time, the moms or dads on duty
                    can entertain the kids.

                    When making plans for the trip, it’s important to discuss expectations
                    about getting takeout, dining out or cooking back in your room if there’s
                    a kitchen or kitchenette. Maybe you are a parent who is not a fan of fast
                    food; other parents like to try fancier sit-down meals. These issues really
                    should be addressed in advance. If anyone in either family has special dietary
                    needs like gluten-free or dairy free, consider separating food and food costs,
                    as the cost of special-diet food can run much, much higher.

                    Plan for sleep
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Children especially need sleep. Avoid planning a long day trip or a full day of
                    activities if the kids are up late the night before. It’s okay to sleep in and
                    take it easy one morning. “A key tip in avoiding getting on someone’s nerves is
                    adequate rest,” says Miller. “When you’re traveling, it’s very easy to keep going
                    from one activity to another without stopping. You should schedule plenty of sleep
                    at night, some days to sleep in, and an afternoon ‘siesta’ to nap or relax; that
                    way you’re recharged.”

                    The bottom line
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Traveling with another family can be fun, economical and has built-in perks
                    like having extra eyes watch your children and keeping the kids entertained. But
                    having a plan in place is key. “When disagreements happen, often it involves the
                    schedule of the day,” says Miller. “If folks know when the next activity is, what
                    museums they’ll be visiting, and where they are eating, there is less room for
                    arguments.” It is also important to leave some room for flexibility during your
                    itinerary. Perhaps you stumble across a water park, or mini-golf course. Leave one
                    or two half days open for last-minute options. Another very important issue is
                    discussing finances and a budget. Costs associated with lodging, meals, activities
                    and more need to be addressed before you go. Happy travels!
